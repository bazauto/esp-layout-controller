## Short backstory (early BR era)
Hollowgate grew around a medieval packhorse route that crossed the valley (“the Hollow”), with the westward track marked by a stone gatehouse. When the branch line was pushed through in the 1890s, the railway couldn’t justify a full station at the village, so a compact goods yard was built just off the main lane and named **Westgate Hollow Yard**. By early BR days it handled coal, fertiliser, cattle, and seasonal produce from nearby farms, with a small engine shed added to keep the pick‑up goods engine and a shunter overnight. As road haulage took over in the 1950s, the yard survived by consolidating traffic for several surrounding villages and using its storage sidings for timber and agricultural machinery.
